        <br>
        <p>I want to make this simple page to feel the vibe that I'm feeling right now.
            I'm chilling smoking and coding. 3 in the morning so I guess I won't be sleeping
            much. Barely slept this weekend too because of work. Let's test out making a list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roll a blunt up</li>
            <li>Have some cereal</li>
            <li>Set up this page to work properly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ok, well that seems to work ok I guess</p>
    </body>
